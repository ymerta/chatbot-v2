In the
Your Widgets
section, you have access to the widgets you created previously. This section allows you to manage and maintain widgets efficiently with the following options:
Search
Quickly find specific widgets by entering keywords. Useful when you have a large library.
Edit
Update design, content, or behavior settings. For example, you may change the look of the close button or update campaign text.
Delete
Remove unwanted widgets permanently. Helps keep your library organized.
Clone
Duplicate an existing widget to create a new version with small modifications.
Example:
If you have a “Welcome Discount” widget offering
10%
, you can use
Edit
to update it to
15%
, instead of creating one from scratch.

Extend Widget
When you select
Blank Widget
, the
Extend Widget
page opens. Here, you configure your widget’s fundamentals and advanced options.
Name
Give your widget a descriptive, memorable name, e.g.,
“Summer Sale Pop-up”
Description
Add a short explanation of the widget’s purpose, e.g., “Promotes seasonal discounts with an interactive pop-up.”
Remove Widget Container
By default, widgets are displayed inside a
container
(a box with defined borders, spacing, and background).
When you enable
Remove Widget Container
, the widget is shown
without this frame
All widget elements (text, buttons, forms, icons, etc.) will appear
directly on the page background
, giving it a cleaner, lighter look.
Widget Closes When Clicked Outside
When this option is enabled, users only need to
tap or click outside the widget area
to close it.
The feature works across
both web and mobile platforms
It provides a smoother, more natural interaction that aligns with common digital behavior patterns.
Type
Choose the widget type best suited for your campaign:
Pop-up:
Eye-catching overlay for promotions, offers, or subscriptions.
Floating Bar
– Slim bar at the top/bottom of the page, ideal for persistent announcements.
Full-Screen:
Occupies the entire screen for maximum impact.
Close Button Location
You can place the close (X) button in any of these positions:
Widget Top-Right
Corner
(default)
Above the Right Corner of Widget
Custom Button Position
This behavior works across both
web and mobile platforms
, allowing you to align interactions with your branding and UX flow.
Custom Button Position
If you select
Custom Button Position
, additional controls will appear:
Right Position
: Adjust the horizontal distance of the button from the right edge (0–100%).
Top Position
: Adjust the vertical distance of the button from the top edge (0–100%).
This flexibility allows you to place the close button anywhere inside the widget, ensuring it never overlaps important content and always matches your layout.
Close Button Color
Choose a color that matches your design. For example, you may use a contrasting color for visibility or a brand color for consistency.
Placement
You can define where the widget itself appears on the user’s screen:
Top
Center
Bottom
Preview the widget in both
desktop and mobile
views to confirm correct alignment.
Example
If you’re creating a
Feedback Pop-up
for mobile users, you could:
Place the widget at the
bottom of the screen
for easy thumb access.
Set the
close button
at the
top-left
, making it stand out from your form fields.
Use your brand’s
accent color
for the close button, ensuring it matches the rest of the widget.
✅ With these options, you have complete control over how your widgets look and behave, from basic design to subtle details like close button placement. Small changes in positioning can make a big impact on
user comfort
and
brand alignment

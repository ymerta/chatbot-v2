Additional Notes
If your file includes device tokens (used for push notifications), Netmera will automatically identify the platform (iOS or Android) based on the structure of the token:
Tokens beginning with strings like
`APA91bG...`
typically represent
Android
devices.
Tokens beginning with strings like
`c2a62...`
are often associated with

devices.
This automatic detection ensures correct routing of notifications without requiring manual platform selection.

Uploading Email and SMS Data for İYS Sync
When managing
İYS (İleti Yönetim Sistemi)
permissions for email and SMS communication, Netmera supports two key models. Each model defines how consent data is handled and synchronized with İYS.
İYS Sync Mode
In this mode, Netmera automatically synchronizes user consent data with İYS.
Consent updates in Netmera (opt-ins or opt-outs) are synced with İYS.
İYS confirmations are reflected back to Netmera.
See full guide on İYS Sync Mode →
IYS Sync Mode
İYS Integrator Mode
In this mode, Netmera acts as an
integrator
, meaning all permission management is led by İYS itself.
Users’ consent status is validated directly to İYS records.
Uploads into Netmera are matched with İYS-confirmed permissions.
See full guide on İYS Integrator Mode →
IYS Integrator Mode
Uploading Email and SMS Data
When uploading contact data for
email and SMS campaigns
, you must include:
Consent status
(e.g., opt-in / opt-out).
Consent date
(timestamp required by İYS).
Consent type
Netmera ensures that the uploaded data is validated against İYS records according to the selected mode (Sync or Integrator). Invalid or missing consent data will be rejected to maintain compliance.

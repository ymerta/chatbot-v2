and
consent status (permission)
are required in the file.

User Matching Logic
When the file is processed, the system checks whether the user already exists. This check follows a
priority sequence
ExID
(if provided)
Email
(if provided)
MSISDN
(if provided)
WhatsApp Number (wpNumber)
If a user is found at any step in this sequence, that user record is used.
If no matching user is found, a
new user profile
is created with the provided details.
Consent Updates
If a
matching user exists
Only the
WhatsApp consent
field is updated.
Other profile information (e.g., ExID, email, MSISDN) is
not changed
If a
new user is created
All provided information in the file (ExID, email, MSISDN, wpNumber, etc.) is added to the new profile.
Number Deduplication
A WhatsApp number can only belong to
one user profile
at a time.
If the same number is found under multiple user profiles:
The system automatically
removes the number
from other users.
The profile from the
most recently imported file
becomes the
master record
for that number.

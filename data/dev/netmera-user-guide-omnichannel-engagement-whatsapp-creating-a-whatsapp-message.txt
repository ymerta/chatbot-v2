Creating a WhatsApp Message
Before creating WhatsApp campaigns in Netmera, make sure the following prerequisites are complete:
Set up your WhatsApp connection through Meta Business Manager
Connect your Meta Business Account to Netmera to enable campaign creation and message delivery.
Review WhatsApp policies, limits, and content rules
Ensure compliance with Meta‚Äôs rules regarding message frequency, opt-in requirements, and allowable content types.

WhatsApp campaigns must use pre-approved templates. Draft your templates in Meta Business Manager, submit them for approval, and only then will they be available for use in Netmera.

fully transition the panel to the new design guide by the end of this year

Step 1: Compose
The
Compose
step is where you set up the content of your WhatsApp campaign before sending it to your audience. In this stage, you will work with a pre-approved WhatsApp template and personalize its elements to match your campaign‚Äôs needs.
Header
You can add an
image
at the top of your message to capture attention.
Click on the header area to upload a file (e.g., PNG or JPG).
The image is displayed above the message text on users‚Äô devices.
Body
This is the
main message text
of your campaign.
If your template includes variables (e.g.,
`{{1}}`
), these placeholders can be replaced dynamically with user data.
Variables Matching
Variables in your template (e.g.,
`{{1}}`
) must be matched with a
profile attribute
from your user database.
Example:
`{{1}}`
‚Üí First Name.
If no value is available for a user, a
Default Value
is applied instead.
This ensures every recipient sees a complete and personalized message.
Footer
A short line of text appears below the main message.
Common use cases: brand signature, disclaimer, or call-to-action reinforcement.
Buttons
WhatsApp templates support interactive buttons to drive engagement. You can configure multiple types:
URL Button ‚Äì Visit Website
Define the button text (e.g., ‚ÄúVisit website‚Äù).
Add a URL (e.g.,
`https://www.google.com/{{1}}`
You may also insert a parameter value (e.g.,
`https://paycell.com.tr/`
Phone Number Button ‚Äì Call Phone Number
Add a button that triggers a direct phone call when tapped.
Useful for support lines, sales teams, or customer service.
Quick Reply ‚Äì Yes/No or Custom Responses
Add predefined reply options (e.g., ‚ÄúYes‚Äù / ‚ÄúNo‚Äù).
Helps guide users through a conversation flow and enables structured responses.
Campaign Preview
On the right-hand side, you can see a
live preview
of how your message will appear on both iOS and Android devices.
This includes the header, body text (with variables applied), footer, and buttons.
Template Details
At the bottom, you‚Äôll see the technical details of the template:
Template Name
(system identifier, e.g.,
`whatsapp_marketing`
Template Category
(e.g., Marketing, Utility, Authentication)
Template Language
(e.g., English)
Test on Device
Before launching your WhatsApp campaign, it‚Äôs important to verify that your template content and personalization appear correctly on real devices.
Choose the identifier type from the dropdown:
External ID
Email
MSISDN (phone number)
WhatsApp Number
Enter the value in the input box (e.g., the specific External ID or phone number).
Click
Add
to register this user as a test recipient and click on
Test on Device
Use real test accounts linked to WhatsApp to ensure accurate validation.
Once you finalize the content, click
Save & Continue
to proceed to the next step in campaign setup.
Step 2: Delivery
The
Delivery
step defines
when
and
how
your WhatsApp campaign messages will be sent to your audience. You can send messages immediately, schedule them for a future date, or set expiry rules.
Campaign Period
The Campaign Period settings let you control the timing of your message delivery:
Send Now
Messages are sent immediately once the campaign is launched.
Best for urgent or time-sensitive campaigns (e.g., flash sales, reminders).
Schedule Your Campaign
Allows you to set a
specific start date and time
for delivery.
Useful for planned campaigns tied to events, promotions, or product launches.
Set Message Expiry Date
Defines an expiry time for the message on the user‚Äôs device.
After the expiry date, the message will no longer be visible in the recipient‚Äôs WhatsApp.
Recommended for limited-time offers or content that should not remain available indefinitely.
Delivery Options
These options control
how messages are distributed
to your selected audience:
Send Fast
Sends all messages immediately after launch.
Best for smaller audiences or when rapid delivery is required.
Ensures maximum impact for time-sensitive announcements.
Send in Packages
Delivers messages in
timed batches
rather than all at once.
Useful for large-scale campaigns, helping manage traffic load and ensuring stable delivery performance.
Often preferred for operational or transactional messaging where delivery pacing is important.
Step 3: Audience
In the
Audience
step, you define
who
will receive your WhatsApp campaign. You can either send the message to all users or create a highly targeted audience using advanced filters.
Options for Audience Selection
Send All Users
Delivers the campaign to all active users who meet the WhatsApp consent requirements.
Recommended for broad announcements, global campaigns, or general notifications.
Create Audience
Allows you to build a
custom audience
by applying filters and conditions.
Useful for segmentation, personalization, and targeted engagement strategies.
Building a Custom Audience
When creating an audience, you can apply
filter rules
based on different user attributes and behaviors.
Root Logic
Choose whether rules will be combined with:
AND
‚Üí All conditions must be true.
‚Üí At least one condition must be true.
Filter Types Available
You can filter users by:
Channel (Mobile, Web, SMS, Email, WhatsApp)
Profile Attribute (e.g., Name, Age, City, Subscription status)
Segment (previously saved audience segments)
Tag (manual or automated user tags)
Platform (iOS, Android, Web)
Response (user actions in past campaigns)

App Installation (whether the app is installed or not)
Operating System
Installation Source
App Tracking (Android Only)

Filter Groups
You can create
groups of conditions
and apply
AND/OR logic
inside them.
Example:
Group A: Channel = Mobile AND Channel = WhatsApp
Group B: Platform = iOS AND Device Model = iPhone 16,1
This allows complex audience targeting with high flexibility.
Rule Description Panel
The right-hand side of the screen shows a
summary of your applied rules
This helps validate whether your filters match your intended targeting logic.

SMS Testing: Add Test Users by External ID
Running tests before launching an SMS campaign is crucial, and now it’s easier and more accessible.
You can now add test users by their External ID (ExID) along with their mobile number.
This feature helps reduce errors and ensures your campaigns reach the right people in the right format from the very first send.
Move Your Widget’s Close Button Anywhere
Your widgets should adapt to your design, not the other way around. That’s why we’ve introduced the ability to customize the position of the close (X) button.
The close icon can now be
moved freely up, down, left, or right
, giving you the flexibility to match your branding and layout.
The behavior works across both web and mobile platforms.
A small visual detail like button placement can have a big impact on user comfort. With this update, you gain more design freedom while keeping interactions intuitive.

Dismiss Widgets by Clicking Outside
Closing a widget should be effortless for your users. With our new update, it now is.
Users can now
click anywhere outside the widget
to dismiss it.
This feature is
optional
and can be toggled in the panel to fit your campaign needs.
The behavior works across both web and mobile platforms.
This improvement gives your users a smoother and more natural browsing experience, reducing friction and aligning with common digital interaction patterns.
Widget Closes When Clicked Outside
Email Validation Now in Widgets
Collecting data is important, but collecting quality data is even more important. That’s why we’ve added new email validation capabilities for widgets.
When a user enters an email, you can now
set a custom error message
(e.g., “Please enter a valid email address”).
If the entered email doesn’t meet the validation rules and the user clicks
Submit
, your defined error message will be displayed instantly.
By preventing invalid inputs at the source, you can maintain cleaner databases, improve the reliability of your campaigns, and provide a clearer, friendlier user experience.
Email Validation in Widgets
Channel-Specific FTP Data Exports
We’ve added a brand-new reporting capability: Export > Channel Permission.
With this feature, you can now:
Select the
specific
channels
you want to include in your reports.
Export your data in either .xlsx or .csv format, depending on your needs.
Simply choose your preferred channels, hit Save, and the report generation process will begin.
This enhancement gives you the freedom to export only the data that’s relevant to your team. Whether you’re analyzing a single channel’s performance or preparing a multi-channel comparison, you’ll have cleaner, faster access to the exact insights you need.

Fine-Tune Precision in Predictive Segments
Personalization and targeting get even smarter with our new manual control over precision levels in predictive segments.
Here’s how it works:
Navigate to Targeting > Segments > AI-Based Segment > Edit.
A new field for Precision Level will appear, allowing you to adjust the setting.
You can then:
Save to confirm your new precision level.

You now have the power to set the balance that best fits your campaign goals.
Precision Level
You can export data in .xlsx or .csv format.
If you select .csv, the Delimiter Type option becomes available.

Export Journey Users
We’ve made important enhancements to the Journey analytics panel that make it easier to take action directly from your campaign data.
A new
download icon
has been added next to analytics metrics within journey components.
By clicking this icon, you can now export user-level data in .csv or .xlsx format.
Once exported, this dataset can be leveraged for tag assignments.
If you see that some users in a journey ended with a 'failed' status, you can export those users, tag them accordingly, and then re-target them via another channel (e.g., email, push, SMS or widget).
It gives your teams the agility to quickly create recovery or re-engagement campaigns and maximize conversion opportunities.
Entry Count Event Metrics
Platform-Specific Push Actions
You can now assign distinct push notification click actions for iOS and Android devices via REST API. For example, within the same push notification, iOS users can be directed to open the app’s home screen, while Android users can be routed to a specific deep link. This feature enables tailored user experiences and offers detailed delivery tracking by platform.
Push Click Actions
Unique Open Rates for Deeper Insights
In addition to open rates, email reports now include Unique Open metrics. This gives you a more accurate view of how many individual users engaged with your message—offering deeper insights into your campaign’s true reach and helping you make more informed, performance-driven decisions.
